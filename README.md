Fantastic Windmill
==================

Fantastic Windmill (FW) is a *static web site generator*: it reads content
from a set of source files, applies a presentation template to them and
saves the output as a set of static HTML files. The main difference with
respect to other generators is that FW relies on a very small set of
concepts to provide the same functionality. As a matter of fact, if you know
how to write web pages in PHP, then setting up a static web site using FW
should be very, very easy. Cloning and tweaking this repository might be
all you need.

For more information, please refer to Fantastic Windmill's
[documentation](http://sylvainhalle.github.io/FantasticWindmill/) --which,
by the way, is probably the shortest of all static web site generators.
Enjoy!
